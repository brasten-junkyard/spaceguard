A BBS Door similar to BRE or SRE. Never released.

Contains horrible spelling. Stopped development due to "random" crashers
that I could never figure out.

Of course now it's obvious that I was blowing through the stack by never
RETURN-ing from my sub routines.

Hey, I was 13 years old.

Requires Door Source 4.x library (not included).
